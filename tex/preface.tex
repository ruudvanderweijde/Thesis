    This thesis could not have been completed without the help and support of various people. 
    In this section I want to thank the people, who helped me during the process, by mentioning their name and shortly explain in which way they supported me.
    I start with a short story on how this research came to be.
    
    \paragraph{}
    The initial idea for this thesis was to dive into the topic of software analysis in order to find vulnerabilities in PHP programs.
    When expanding further on this topic, my interest in statical analysis grew and I planned to reconstruct data flows in programs to allow taint analysis.
    In order to perform dataflow analysis for object oriented PHP programs, the types of expressions need to be known.
    This topic of resolving the run-time types at compile time was big enough to solely write a thesis on.
    
    \paragraph{}
    The First person I need to thank is Jurgen Vinju, who helped me throughout the whole process.
    I want to thank Jurgen for his endless enthusiasm, number of ideas and suggestions and personal help on coaching and mentoring me.
    Jurgen helped defining a research topic and gave me many directions where to go or look for whenever I got stuck on a subject.
    
    \paragraph{}
    Next I want to thank Mark Hills.
    The implementation of this research is build on top of the PHP Analysis in Rascal (PHP AiR) framework, created by Mark.
    This research uses the PHP AiR framework to parse PHP files to Rascal ASTs.
    We expanded the project with an implementation of an $M^3$ model for PHP programs and a constraint extractor and solver.
    I'm happy that I could contribute to the project in return.
    
    \paragraph{}
    I want to thank Bas Basten for the collaboration on improving and extending the $M^3$ model.
    After creating the initial version of the $M^3$ model for PHP, Bas helped to improved the model by adding more program information to the model.
    With his expertise on Rascal and and my knowledge of PHP we formed a solid team.
    
    \paragraph{}
    I would like to thank Winfred Peereboom for giving me the opportunity to write my thesis at Werkspot.
    During the period Winfred helped me on various aspects of coaching and mentoring me.
	
    \paragraph{}
    Finally I want to thank my girlfriend for her endless support and patience.
    And of course I want to thank everyone I forgot to mention here personally, but who did help me direct or indirect, conscious or unconscious.
