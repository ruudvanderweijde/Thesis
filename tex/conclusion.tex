    \chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
    Summary of the whole work, with conclusions. T.B.A.
    
    \section{Conclusion}
    
    \section{Future work}
    These items will not be covered by the analysis (maybe add this to threats/future work)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analysis is flow insensitive
        \item Closure
        \item References
        \item Variable constructs (variable -variable, -method/function calls, -class instantiation, eval) :: todo: explain WHY not.
        \item Yields
    \end{itemize}

    
    \paragraph{}
    Explain something about combining this analysis to other analysis (like dead code elimination, constant folding/propagation resolve, alias analysis, array analysis) to gain more precise results.
    
    \paragraph{}
    Something about performance optimisations... Explain what is already done to boost the performance and what still can be done.
        
    \paragraph{}
    Use a bigger corpus to gains better results of the analysis by doing analysis on more programs.
    
    \section{Threats to validity}
    When relying on annotations for analysis, the annotations need to be correct and sound.
    The hard part is that the annotations are not examined on runtime, and are therefor not easily validated.
