    \chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
    In this section we present the conclusion in section \ref{conclusion:conclusion}
    
    \section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion:conclusion}
    In this work we have presented a type inference implementation written in Rascal.
    We presented a theoretical constraint based type inference algorithm.
    This type constraint algorithm is implemented with a PHP parser written in PHP and constraint extractor written in Rascal.
    To resolve the constraints we also created a constraint solver in Rascal.
    The results of the constrain solver is a list of code expressions and their possible set of types.
    \\
    In a small evaluation we have performed the type inference on a few small projects.
    Here we found that adding annotations resulted in inferring more types for almost all projects.
    When we also added type information about PHP built-in classes, functions, and variables, we only saw a small improvement in one of the projects.
    Hereby we could conclude, although the number of projects is to small to generalise the results, we saw a good improvement when adding type annotations from PHPDocs, but no extra improvement when also adding PHP built-in information.
    
    \section{Future work}\label{conclusion:future-work}
    There are various extensions of this research possible.
    The constraint based type inference could be combined with other analysis, like file include resolutions, dead code elimination, reference/alias analysis, and constant folding/propagation.
    By including these other analyses it should be possible to get more precise results.
    \\
    The performance of the constraint solver could be optimised.
    In our version we didn't take any effort to optimise the algorithm.
    But we've seen that the algorithm is too slow to be able to run on bigger code bases.
    Also if you would want to use this real time in an IDE, the run time of the script should be decreased.
    If the performance of the type inference is improved it is also easier to validate the results of this analysis by adding more projects to the evaluation.
    \\
    At the moment of writing the implementation was PHP7 not released.
    The benefit we've seen on adding type annotation is optionally implemented in PHP7.
    It would be interesting to use the new language constructs and compare the results with PHP5 programs.
    
    \section{Threats to validity}\label{conclusion:threats-to-validity}	
    Because we perform an over approximation of run time values at compile time, the results of the type inference are not 100\% accurate.
    With the dynamic nature of the programming language and the usage of dynamic features it is a challenge to be as accurate as possible.
		
	\paragraph{Missing constraints}
	By adding a constraint we limit the number of possible types for that expression.
	Because we are humans, it could be possible that we make a mistake by missing a constraint or adding a wrong constraint.
	This could result in type inference results that are wrong.
	
	\paragraph{Law of small numbers}
	Because our small sample size in our evaluation, we cannot generalise these results.
	In order to gain more precise results we should increase our sample size.
	We can achieve this by running analysis on more software projects in the future.
	
	\paragraph{Object references}
	One thing we do not take into account are the side effects that can be caused by the passing arguments as reference.
	When an referenced argument is modified, the referenced variable is also modified.
	This could theoretically lead to type changes.
	
	\paragraph{PHPDoc correctness}
	In this research we also assume that the provided type annotations in the PHPDoc's are correct.
	These annotations are ignored during program execution and therefore could be incorrect without noticing.
	Using PHP7 new type hint language constructs could help to ensure that we extract the correct constraints for the source code.
