    \chapter{Background and Related Work}\label{ch:background}
    Chapter \ref{ch:background} describes seven important language constructs which the reader needs to understand in order to understand the difficulties of analysing PHP in section \ref{sec:background_language-constructs}.
    The second section, section \ref{sec:background_annotations}, introduces the syntax and usage of annotations in PHP.
    Section \ref{sec:background_rascal} explains \Gls{Rascal}, the programming language used for the analysis.
    $M^3$ is described in more details in section \ref{sec:background_m3}.
    $M^3$ is a programming language independent meta model which holds various facts about programs. 
    Section \ref{sec:background_type-system} introduces type systems and how type systems relate to this research.
    The last section of this chapter, section \ref{sec:background_related-work}, describes the related work and how these researches are related to this thesis.

    \section{PHP Language Constructs}\label{sec:background_language-constructs}
    PHP has various language constructs which complicate statical analysis. 
    This section presents language constructs and why these constructs are important for this research.
    Explanations of these constructs help you to understand the performed analysis.
    The discussed parts are scope, file includes, conditional classes and functions, dynamic features, late static binding, magic methods and dynamic class properties.
    
    \paragraph{Scope}
    In PHP, all classes and functions are globally accessible once they are declared.
    All classes and functions are implicitly public, inner classes are not allowed, and conditional functions (see paragraph about conditional classes and functions) will be available in the global scope.
    If a class or function is declared inside a namespace, their name is prefixed with the name of the namespace.
    \\
    Variables have three scope levels: global-, function-, and method-scope.
    Under normal circumstances when a variable is declared inside a function or method, their scope is limited to this function or method.
    Variables declared outside function or methods are available in the global scope, but not in the method or function scope.
    There is an exception for some predefined global variables which are available everywhere. 
    Examples are \texttt{\$GLOBALS}, \texttt{\$\_POST}, and \texttt{\$\_GET}. 
    Variables inside a function or method can be aliased to a global variable by adding the keyword \texttt{GLOBAL} in front of the variable name.
    The variable are then linked to the global variable in the symbol table\footnotemark.
    \footnotetext{http://php.net/manual/en/language.variables.scope.php, July 2014}
    \\
    Closures (anonymous functions in PHP) have the same scoping rules as variables, but they can inherit variables from outside their scope by providing them in the use statement. 
    %In this research we will not support closures. 
    
    \paragraph{Includes}
    PHP allows files to include other PHP-files during execution of the program. 
    The content of these files will be loaded inline. 
    This means that if you use an include in the middle of a file, the source code of this file will be inserted virtually at that place.
    In this research we will not perform an include analysis.
    Instead we will assume that all files in the project are included during execution. 
    %We have checked all projects for duplicate classes and functions but we have found none.
    %Therefor we assume that this does not effect the outcome of the analysis.
    %It is not known if there are effects on inline includes that we do not cover.
    \\
    According to the php coding standard\footnotemark, function- and class-name classes should not appear when using namespaces and autoloading.
    \footnotetext{http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-0/, July 2014}
    When a class which is not already loaded in memory, the autoloading function will try to include a file and load the class.
    The structure of the autoloading is meant to include classes, interfaces, traits, and functions and should not have inline code executions which would lead to side-effects.
    
    \paragraph{Conditional classes and functions}
    Once a file is included in the execution, al the classes and functions in the top scope are declared.
    All class and function declarations within condition statements or within a method or function scope are only declared when the code is executed.
    \\
    An example of an conditional statement can be found in listing \ref{lst:conditionals1}.
    If the class \texttt{Foo} or function \texttt{bar} to not exist before the statements is executed, then the class and function will not yet declared. 
    When you try to use the class or function before the code is executed, the script will exit with an fatal error.

    \lstinputlisting[language=PHP,label=lst:conditionals1,caption=Conditional class and function definitions]{src/php/conditionals1.php}

    More examples of dynamic function and class loading is displayed in listing \ref{lst:conditionals2}.
    If the first call is \texttt{g()} as you can see in \texttt{line 8}, the script will result in a fatal error because \texttt{function g()} will only be declared after \texttt{function f()} is executed.
    The \texttt{class C} will be declared once \texttt{function g()} is executed.
    As soon as the functions and classes are declared, they are available in the top scope, possibly prefixed with the name of the namespace they are declared within.
    \lstinputlisting[language=PHP,label=lst:conditionals2,caption=Conditional function declaration]{src/php/conditionals2.php}

    
    \paragraph{Dynamic features}
    PHP comes with dynamic features like: include dynamic variables, dynamic class instantiations, dynamic function calls, dynamic function creation, reflection, and eval.
    These features allow code to change during compile time. 
    New functions and classes can be declared on the fly.
    Method calls, or even whole pieces of code, can be executed based on variable strings.
    \\
    A previous study by Mark Hills\cite{Hil:13} has shown that most real applications make use of dynamic features.
    %todo (background:dynamic features) check study of mark hills
    Dynamic features powerful, but can complicate the statical analysis.
    Additional analysis like constant propagation is needed to resolve most of these dynamic features.
    This is not in scope for this research.
    
    \paragraph{Late static binding}
    Late static binding\footnotemark is implemented in PHP since version 5.3 by adding the keyword \texttt{static} to the language.
    \footnotetext{http://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.late-static-bindings.php, July 2014}
    It's usage is similar to the keyword \texttt{self}, which refers to the current class. 
    The main difference is that \texttt{self} refers to the class where the code is located, while \texttt{static} refers to the actual instantiated class.
    The keyword \texttt{self} can be easily resolved while \texttt{static} can only be resolved on runtime.
    For the keyword \texttt{self} we will have to refer to the class it's declared in, plus all their descended classes.
    
    \paragraph{Magic methods}
    PHP allows calls and property access on methods and fields that don't exist on a class.
    Normally a call to a non-existing method or property would result in a fatal error, but with the use of magic methods you can specify the wanted behavior.
    Listing \ref{lst:magicMethods} shows an example of the \texttt{\_\_{}call} method.
    This method is triggered when a non-accessible or non-existing method is called.
    In this example the code will try to return the value of a private property based on the provided name.
    The full list of magic methods is \texttt{\_\_{}construct}, \texttt{\_\_{}destruct}, \texttt{\_\_{}call}, \texttt{\_\_{}callStatic}, \texttt{\_\_{}get}, \texttt{\_\_{}set}, \texttt{\_\_{}isset}, \texttt{\_\_{}unset}, \texttt{\_\_{}wakeup}, \texttt{\_\_{}toString}, \texttt{\_\_{}invoke}, \texttt{\_\_{}set\_state}, \texttt{\_\_{}clone}, and \texttt{\_\_{}debugInfo}.
	
	\lstinputlisting[language=PHP,label=lst:magicMethods,caption=Magic methods in PHP]{src/php/magicMethods.php}

    \paragraph{Dynamic class properties}
    Although it is a good practice to define your class properties, it is not required to do so in PHP.
    After instantiating a class it is possible to add properties to classes, even without the implementation of magic methods.
    In listing \ref{lst:dynamicProperty} you can see a code sample of adding a property after instantiation of a class.
    The access of the non-existing property \texttt{nonExistingProperty} will result in a warning, but code execution will continue and will just return \texttt{NULL}.
    The code on \texttt{line 4} is where the property is written.
    The object \texttt{\$c} will have the \texttt{nonExistingProperty} publicly available now.
    But in a new class instantiation, like you can see on \texttt{line 6}, will not have the property there.
    
    \lstinputlisting[language=PHP,label=lst:dynamicProperty,caption=Dynamic class property]{src/php/dynamicProperty.php}
    
    \section{Annotations}\label{sec:background_annotations}
    Annotations are pieces of meta data, defined on class, method, function, or statement level.
    Despite the proposal\footnotemark for official support of annotations, PHP has still no native support them.
    \footnotetext{https://wiki.php.net/rfc/annotations-in-docblock}
    But PHP has a \texttt{getDocComment}\footnotemark method in the \texttt{ReflectionClass} since version 5.1 in 2005. 
    \footnotetext{http://php.net/manual/en/reflectionclass.getdoccomment.php}
    The \texttt{getDocComment} method returns the complete doc block of a certain element as a string.
    A doc block in php has the format \texttt{\slash**...*\slash}.
    Listing \ref{lst:docblock} shows an example of two doc blocks in PHP.
    The first doc block is defined above the class and contains information about the class.
    The second doc block is related to the method \texttt{getSomething}. 
    The block contains a short description of the method, provides type hints for the parameter and the return type, and provides information which possible exceptions can be thrown by the method. 
    
    \lstinputlisting[language=PHP,label=lst:docblock,caption=Examples of PHP DocBlocks]{src/php/docBlock.php}

    Annotations are mainly used for type hinting, documentation, and code execution.
    Software analysis tools and IDE's can use the type hints to aid understanding code and in finding bugs and security issues.
    Available tools can generate documentation based on the doc blocks.
    Programs like Symfony2, ZEND Framework, and Doctrine ORM use annotations for controller routing, templating information, ORM mappings, filters, and validation configuration.
    \\
    This research focusses on the first type of annotations which can help developers and IDE's to better understand how code behaves within a program.
    For example a programmer can see what kind of input and output is expected for a method.
    Doc blocks with annotations can be placed on top of classes, methods, functions, and variables.
    \\
    A standard on using annotations is not in the PHP Standard Recommendations (\gls{PSR}) yet, but there is a proposal\footnotemark.
    \footnotetext{https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/pull/169/files, July 2014}
    For this research we will only focus on the \texttt{@param}, \texttt{@return}, \texttt{@var}, and \texttt{@inheritDoc} annotations.
    The annotations \texttt{@return} and \texttt{@param} are only useful for functions, class methods, and closures.
    Type hints are described with \texttt{@var} and can be used on all structures, but mainly occur on variables and class fields.
    \\
    There is no official standard for the use of annotations, but most projects follow the phpDocumentor\footnotemark{} syntax.
    \footnotetext{http://www.phpdoc.org/}
    For this research the following annotations are considered:
    
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \texttt{@return}=\begin{cases}
    \texttt{@return} \; type, & \text{unconditionally read \texttt{@return} $type$}.\\
  \end{cases}
  \end{aligned}
  \phantom{\hspace{8cm}} %%<---adjust the value as you want
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \texttt{@param}=\begin{cases}
    \texttt{@param} \; type \; \$var, & \text{if `\texttt{@param} $type$ \$var' occurs at least once}.\\
    \texttt{@param} \; \$var \; type, & \text{else if `\texttt{@param} \$var $type$' occurs at least once}.\\
    \texttt{@param} \; type, & \text{otherwise try to match `\texttt{@param} $type$'}.\\
  \end{cases}
  \end{aligned}
  \phantom{\hspace{3.55cm}} %%<---adjust the value as you want
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  \texttt{@var}=\begin{cases}
    \texttt{@var} \; type \; \$var, & \text{if `\texttt{@var} $type$ \$var' occurs at least once}.\\
    \texttt{@var} \; \$var \; type, & \text{else if `\texttt{@var} \$var $type$' occurs at least once}.\\
    \texttt{@var} \; type, & \text{otherwise try to match `\texttt{@var} $type$'}.\\
  \end{cases}
  \end{aligned}
  \phantom{\hspace{3.2cm}} %%<---adjust the value as you want
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
  type=\begin{cases}
    type|type, & \text{if `$\vert$' in $type$}.\\
    type, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases}
  \end{aligned}
  \phantom{\hspace{8.8cm}} %%<---adjust the value as you want
\end{equation}
	%todo: (background:annotations) explain the used equations above.
 
    \section{Rascal}\label{sec:background_rascal}
    \Gls{Rascal}\cite{Kli:09} is a meta programming language developed by Centrum Wiskunde \& Informatica (CWI).
    Rascal is designed to analyse, transform and visualise source code.
    The language is build on top of Java and implements various concepts of existing programming languages.
    In this research, Rascal is the main programming language.
    The only part that does not use Rascal is the parser of PHP code.
    Although this could be easily implemented in Rascal, there was an existing library written in PHP available.

    \section{$M^3$}\label{sec:background_m3}
    The $M^3$-model\cite{Ana:13} is a model which holds various information of source code and is implemented in Rascal.
    % todo explain its general usage
    This model is created to gain insights in the quality of open-source projects.
    For our research we use the $M^3$-model to store facts about the program in a structured way, so we can easily use it at a later stage.
    
    The core element of the $M^3$-model contains \texttt{containment}, \texttt{declarations}, \texttt{documentation}, \texttt{modifiers}, \texttt{names}, \texttt{types}, \texttt{uses}, \texttt{messages}.
    The \texttt{declarations} relation contains class, method, variable- information with their logical name and their real location. The type of the relation are \texttt{locations} and represent the logical name of the declaration and will be used in the rest of the $M^3$.
    The \texttt{containment} relation has information on what declarations are contained in each other. For example a package can contain a class; a class can contain fields and methods or an inner class; a method can contain variables.    
    The \texttt{documentation} relation contains all comments from the source code and its source location.
    The \texttt{modifiers} relation has information on the modifiers of declarations. Modifiers are abstract, final, public, protected, or private.
    The \texttt{names} relation contains a simplified name of the full declarations.
    The \texttt{types} relation has information about the type of the source code elements.
    The \texttt{uses} relation describes what references use an object. For instance when a field of a class is used in some expression, the \texttt{uses} relation links the field in the expression to the declaration of the field in the class.
    And lastly, \texttt{messages} contains errors, warnings, and info statements.
    
    %todo add duck typing as sub part of Type Systems
    \section{Type system}\label{sec:background_type-system}
    Type systems define how a set of rules are applied to types in their context.
    The system validates the type usage with \textbf{type checking}.
    The process of resolving types is called \textbf{type inference}.
    On one hand the system needs to determine the type of variables, on the other hand it will check the type of the variables.
    
    \paragraph{Type checking}
    Type checking is a mechanism which validates and/or enforces the constraints of a type in their specific context.
    There is a difference between static type checking and dynamic type checking.
    \textbf{Static type checking} is a process of checking the types based on the source code.
    The static type checker will ensure that a program is type safe before executing the program, which means that there will occur no type errors during runtime.
    \textbf{Dynamic type checking} performs the type checking during runtime.
    This means that the program needs to run to gain feedback on the usage of types.
    PHP is a dynamically typed language, which means that there are no types checked before actually running the program.
    There are languages, like JAVA, which have use a combination of static and dynamic type checking.
    The advantage of static type checking is that type errors can be caught early in the development process and allows for compiler optimisations.
    Dynamic type checking systems have more flexibility and allow dynamic loading of new code.
    
    \paragraph{Type inference}
    Type inference is the process of resolving the type of a variable or expression.
    This process is required to be able perform type checking.
    Being able to infer the type before running the program enables you to optimise code execution by applying compiler optimisations.
    These optimisation allow performance improvements or reduce memory usage.
    In dynamic languages like PHP it can be difficult to resolve the type of a variable or expression without running the program.
    In statically typed languages, type inference happens at compile time.
    In this paragraph we explain four types of type inference algorithms.
    \\
    The \textbf{Hindley-Milner} (HM) type system was found in 1969 by Roger J. Hinldey\cite{Hin:69} and almost 10 years later rediscovered by Robin Milner\cite{Mil:78}.
    The first implementation, \textbf{Algorithm W}\cite{Dam:82} which proved the soundness and completeness, was four years later created by pHd student Luis Damas in the context of the programming language \texttt{ML}.
    The HM type system deduces the types of the variables based on their usage to their most abstract type.
    The type system of \texttt{Haskell} uses the HM type system as a foundation.
    \\
    The \textbf{Cartesian Product Algorithm}\cite{Age:95} (CPA) is a type inference algorithm created by Ole Agesen.
    His work was based on the \textbf{basic type inference algorithm}\cite{Pal:91} of Palsberg and Schwartzbach.
    These algorithms build a constraint graph and solve the constraints using a fixed point algorithm.
    The scope of a constraint graph is based on the control flow and is called a template.
    The start and end nodes of the templates are connected to the other templates.
	\\
    \textbf{kth-order control-flow analysis}!!need citation!! ($k$-CFA) and  are two other ways of type inference.
    %todo (background:k-cfa/cpa) explain K-CFA en CPA
    In $k$-CFA. 
    \\
    The analysis we perform is flow insensitive, which means that we do not analyse the flows of the program.
    We do take the context of the programs into account, making the analysis context sensitive.
    \\
    % re-structure the stuff below
    In this research we use \textbf{constraint based type inference}.
    Every typeable language construct will have a set of possible types.
    At the start of the analysis every variable and expression will have all possible types, we call this \texttt{Universe}.
    Then we will read all the constraints and will try to solve them.
    Every time a constraint is solved, the number of possible types for one variable will decrease.
    This process will be repeated until we have solved all the constraints and can no longer limit the number of types for a variable.
    This is explained in more details in chapter \ref{sec:research:constraint_solving}.
    
    \section{Constraint solvers}\label{sec:background_constraint-solver}

    What is a constraint solver?
