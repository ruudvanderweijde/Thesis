    \chapter{Results}\label{chap:results}
    For the results we picked X software products to see how it performs.
    For each product we performed the type inference with and without reading annotations from the doc blocks.
    
    \section{Results}
    Show the results...
    
    \section{Validation of the results (or something)}
    Say something about:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Soundness (what we measured, is it correct?)
        \item Completeness (how much did we measure?)
        \item Accuracy (how precise are the results?)
    \end{itemize}

    \section{Annotations}
    The results of the analysis when adding the annotations to the analysis. Compare the results with the results of the analysis without the annotation information.
