    %This section will contain:
    %TODO: Explain the used method. %TODO research method
    %TODO: Hypothese/research questions %TODO research question

    \section{Introduction}
    $<<$ Todo: properly introduction of this chapter $>>$
        
    
    
    \section{Research Question}
    The research question will be something like: \\
    \begin{quote}
        Will the use of phpdoc annotations produce better (to be defined) results for constraint based type inference?
    \end{quote}
    
    \section{Put this somewhere}
    Todo: put this text somewhere....
    \begin{itemize}
        \item We assume that the program is correct. This means that warnings can happen, but fatal errors not.
        \item We assume that all files are included.
        \item We assume that register globals is off! (maybe add some other runtime environments)
        \item Ingore warnings (because most production code has them off)
    \end{itemize}
    These items will not be covered by the anlysis (maybe add this to threats/future work)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Analysis is flow insensitive
        \item Closure
        \item References
        \item Variable constructs (variable -variable, -method/function calls, -class instantiation, eval) :: todo: explain WHY not.
        \item Yields
        
    \end{itemize}
